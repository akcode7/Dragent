The Dragent project represents our vision for how AI can enhance healthcare accessibility without replacing human expertise. During this hackathon, we faced numerous challenges in ensuring the AI responses were medically sound while being clearly presented as informational rather than diagnostic. The integration of multiple specialized AI models was particularly challenging but ultimately rewarding when we saw how each medical domain benefitted from tailored AI approaches. We're proud of creating a solution that bridges the gap between immediate health information needs and professional medical care.
