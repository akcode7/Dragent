Email and password login
Email and password login is the most commonly used authentication method. Appwrite Authentication promotes a safer internet by providing secure APIs and promoting better password choices to end users. Appwrite supports added security features like blocking personal info in passwords, password dictionary, and password history to help users choose good passwords.

Signup
You can use the Appwrite Client SDKs to create an account using email and password.



import { Client, Account, ID } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>'); // Your project ID

const account = new Account(client);

const promise = account.create('[USER_ID]', 'email@example.com', '');

promise.then(function (response) {
    console.log(response); // Success
}, function (error) {
    console.log(error); // Failure
});
Passwords are hashed with Argon2, a resilient and secure password hashing algorithm.

Login

After an account is created, users can be logged in using the Create Email Session route.



import { Client, Account } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>'); // Your project ID

const account = new Account(client);

const promise = account.createEmailPasswordSession('email@example.com', 'password');

promise.then(function (response) {
    console.log(response); // Success
}, function (error) {
    console.log(error); // Failure
});
